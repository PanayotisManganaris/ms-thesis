  journal =	 {CoRR},
  year =	 2017,
  url =		 {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874v2},
  abstract =	 {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction
                  can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in
                  many applications. However, the highest accuracy for
                  large modern datasets is often achieved by complex
                  models that even experts struggle to interpret, such
                  as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a
                  tension between accuracy and interpretability. In
                  response, various methods have recently been
                  proposed to help users interpret the predictions of
                  complex models, but it is often unclear how these
                  methods are related and when one method is
                  preferable over another. To address this problem, we
                  present a unified framework for interpreting
                  predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive
                  exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an
                  importance value for a particular prediction. Its
                  novel components include: (1) the identification of
                  a new class of additive feature importance measures,
                  and (2) theoretical results showing there is a
                  unique solution in this class with a set of
                  desirable properties.  The new class unifies six
                  existing methods, notable because several recent
                  methods in the class lack the proposed desirable
                  properties. Based on insights from this unification,
                  we present new methods that show improved
                  computational performance and/or better consistency
                  with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  abstract =	 {Predicting the properties of a material from the
                  arrangement of its atoms is a fundamental goal in
                  materials science. In recent years, machine learning
                  (ML) on ab initio calculations has emerged as a new
                  paradigm to provide rapid predictions of materials
                  properties across vast chemical spaces. However, the
                  performances of ML models are determined by the
                  quantity and quality of data, which tend to be
                  inversely correlated with each other. Here, we
                  develop multi-fidelity materials graph networks
                  (MFGNet) to transcend this trade-off to achieve
                  accurate predictions of the experimental band gaps
                  of ordered and disordered materials to within
                  0.3-0.5 eV. We show that the inclusion of
                  low-fidelity Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof band gaps
                  significantly enhances the resolution of latent
                  structural features in materials graph
                  representations, leading to 22-45 \% decrease in the
                  mean absolute errors of high-fidelity computed and
                  experimental band gap predictions with an order of
                  magnitude smaller data sizes. Further, MFGNet models
                  can be readily extended to predict the band gaps of
                  disordered crystals to excellent agreement with
                  experiments, addressing a major gap in the
                  computational prediction of materials properties.},
