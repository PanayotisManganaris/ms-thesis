\begin{abstract}%
  In this article, we report machine learning models trained on existing
  datasets of halide perovskite bandgaps based on first principles
  computations performed at different fidelities. The primary objective
  of these models is to predict the perovskite bandgap using the
  composition and inherent elemental properties as descriptors,
  eventually leading to accurate prediction and screening across much
  larger chemical spaces. We utilize a recently published density
  functional theory (DFT) dataset of > 1000 perovskite bandgaps from 4
  different levels of theory, added to an experimental perovskite
  bandgap dataset of $\sim$ 100 points, to train random forest
  regression (RFR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and Sure
  Independent Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) regression
  models, with data fidelity added as one-hot encoded features. We find
  that xxx yields the best model with a bandgap root mean square error
  of zzz on the total dataset and zzz on just the experimental
  points. SISSO provides compound features and functions for direct
  prediction of band gap, but errors are larger than from RFR and
  GPR. Additional insights are gained from Pearson correlation and
  Shapley analysis. Finally, the best model is deployed for prediction
  of experimental band gap of $\sim$ 40,000 hypothetical compounds,
  based on which we screen yyy compounds with band gap predicted to be
  between 1 and 2 eV.
